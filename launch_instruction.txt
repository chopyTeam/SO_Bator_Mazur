2.1. Using Docker
 1. Navigate to main directory of a project (the one with docker-compose.yml file) using 
  Terminal in Linux or CMD in Windows.
 2. Pull frontend and backend images from Dockerhub by typing command:
  docker pull marcinbator/bridgeproblem_frontend
  docker pull marcinbator/bridgeproblem_backend
 3. Run containers with settings from docker-compose.yml:
  docker-compose up
  By default, the backend of the project will listen on port 8080, and the frontend will listen 
  on port 3000. If you want to change those values, you can do it by editing them in dockercompose.yml file. Make sure that the ports are    not occupied by other processes.
 4. To see the OPENAPI documentation of the backend endpoints, open 
  http://localhost:8080/api/docs.html in web browser.
 5. To open the application, open http://localhost:3000 in web browser. If no cars appear 
  after adding them, you have to refresh cache of your browser (Ctrl+F5 in Chrome).

2.2. Using IDE
 2.2.1. Backend
  You will need IntelliJ IDEA or other IDE that can run Spring Boot project from Maven. Open the 
  bridgeproblem_backend folder in IDE and run the BridgeProblemBackendApplication class. The 
  service will listen on port 8080.
 2.2.2. Frontend
  You need to have installed Node 20 on your machine or environment. Navigate to 
  bridgeproblem_frontend directory and run the command:
  npm run dev
  The service will listen on port 3000.
